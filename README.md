If the user wants to remove such a product from his cart, the system has given him the opportunity to do so. Also, the option to change the quantity of the product is given in the footer. If the user wants to clear the cart, that too is given the opportunity.
Finally, if the user wants to buy these products, he is given the opportunity to enter his details after applying chechout (90).
Payment Methods
 
We have provided several payment methods in Mahi. Accordingly, the user can use a payment method of his choice and make payments. The example shows how to make a payment through a Visa card. This payment does not actually happen. But we have added something like this to the system to make it real.
After making the payment
 
After making the payment, the user will see his receipt. Also, the user has been given the opportunity to download his receipt through the system. By entering 97, the user can download his receipt.
 
The receipt will be stored in the DOWNLOADS directory of your computer. It is created in HTML so it can be opened through any web browser. Below is the receipt.
